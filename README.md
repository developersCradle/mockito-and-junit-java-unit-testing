# Notes from every chapter

<img src="NeedForMockito.PNG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- This could fail if website is unavailable
	- We can solve this using mocks

<img src="mock.PNG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- Junit does not provide mocking ability :(
	- In Java world, most popular are **JMockit**, **EASYMOCK** and **Mockito** by far the most popular at the writing time
- Mockito needs at least Java 8 version

<img src="class_diagram.png" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- Don't mock methods from `BookService`
	- Test all methods from `BookService`
- ``new BookingService(paymentService, roomService, bookingDAO, mailSender)``
	- We want to mock out dependencies form this service
		- Basic way to do this is using mock
		``this.paymentService = mock(PaymentService.class);``
- By default Mockito uses **nice mocks**
	- returns values makes sense
	- Nice mocks default values:
		- Empty list
		- Null Object
		- 0 / false primitives
- We can specify return type for specific input or any all input

```
when(this.roomServiceMock.getAvailableRooms()).thenReturn(Collections.singletonList(new Room("Room 1", 2)));
```

- When() something happens then ‚Üí do something
	- Chaining when then
		- This changes default behavior from empty list to single element list
		- Now when `getAvailableRooms()` is called return list with new Room 
- Returning value first time, different value when calling second time
- We can chain multiple returns 1:nd call and 2nd call

```
.thenReturn(Collections.singletonList(new Room("Room 1", 5))) 	// First time called should return one room
.thenReturn(Collections.emptyList());							// Second time called should return empty
```

- And assert it with following

```		assertAll(
				() -> 	assertEquals(expectedFirstCall, actualFirst),
				() -> 	assertEquals(expectedSecondCall, actualSecond)
				);
```

- Testing exception throwing 

```
BookingRequest bookingRequest = new BookingRequest("1", LocalDate.of(2020, 01, 01), LocalDate.of(2020, 01, 05), 2, false);		
		when(this.roomServiceMock.findAvailableRoomId(bookingRequest))
		.thenThrow(BusinessException.class);`
	
		Executable executable = () -> bookingService.makeBooking(bookingRequest);
		
		//Then
		assertThrows(BusinessException.class, executable);	
```

- `any()` any kind of input

<img src="mockitoGoldenArgumentRules.PNG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

* `verify(paymentServiceMock).pay(bookingRequest, 400.0);`
* Verify `pay()` is called from `paymentServiceMock` with these `(bookingRequest, 400.0)` arguments
* `verifyNoMoreInteractions(paymentServiceMock);` // Check if `paymentServiceMock` was called once
	
- Spies partial mocks = dummy object with no real logic
	- spy = real object with real 

- Defining "behavior" for spies, is a other way around than for mocks

<img src="spy.PNG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- Spy is partial mock, uses code from actual class
- void methods does not fork with when then pattern

```
when(this.mailSenderMock.sendBookingConfirmation(any())).thenThrow(BusinessException.class);
```

- We need `doThrSow`
- If you want exception from void method use `doThrow.when` pattern
- Argument captor allows us to capture arguments passed to methods
 
```
verify(paymentServiceMock, times(1)).pay(eq(bookingRequest), doubleCaptor.capture());
double capturedArgument = doubleCaptor.getValue();
```

- Capturing argument which was passed to Pay() method

- Old way declaring mocks`this.paymentServiceMock = mock(PaymentService.class);`
- New and recommended way is using annotations `@Mock` replaces upper declaration

- To match names in given when pattern, we can use BDD. Just different naming pattern

<img src="tddNaming.PNG" alt="alt text" width="300"/>

- When and then changes to given `willReturn`

```
when(this.roomServiceMock.getAvailableRooms()).thenReturn(Collections.singletonList(new Room("Room 1", 5)));
```

- Changes to 

```
given(this.roomServiceMock.getAvailableRooms()).willReturn(Collections.singletonList(new Room("Room 1", 5)));`
``` 

<hr>

```
verify(paymentServiceMock, times(1)).pay(bookingRequest, 400.0);
``` 

- Changes to

```
then(paymentServiceMock).should(times(1)).pay(bookingRequest, 400.0);`
```

- **Strict stubbing**
- Using annotation in Mockito turns on feature called **Strict stubbing**`@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)`

<img src="stubbing.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- Stubbing is defining behavior of your classes

``` 
when(paymentServiceMock.pay(any(), anyDouble())).thenReturn("1"); //unnecessary stubbing
```

- If this is defined in test and not actually called ‚Üí exception is throw since **strict stubbing** expects it to be called 
	- Nice feature, forces to keep test neat and clean
- to counter this **Mockito** allows use of `lenient()`

```
lenient().when(paymentServiceMock.pay(any(), anyDouble())).thenReturn("1"); //unnecessary stubbing works with lenient()
```

- Should not be using `lenient()` in first place, since clean tests are more wanted!

- Mocking static methods is still experimental in Mockito, should use Example **PowerMock**
- To use mocking static methods, needs to enable **experimental**(at the time of 2020) feature in Mockito

```
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
		<artifactId>mockito-core
		</artifactId>
		<version>3.5.13</version>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
```

To

```
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
		<artifactId>mockito-inline</artifactId>
		<version>3.5.13</version>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
```

- Mocking static method

```
	  @Test
	  void should_calculateCorrectPrize() {
		  
		  try(MockedStatic<CurrencyConverter> mockedConverter = mockStatic(CurrencyConverter.class)) {

	    // Given
	    BookingRequest bookingRequest =
	        new BookingRequest("1", LocalDate.of(2020, 01, 01), LocalDate.of(2020, 01, 05), 2, false);
	    
	    double expected = 400.0;
	    
	    mockedConverter.when(() -> CurrencyConverter.toEuro(anyDouble())).thenReturn(400.0);
	    
	    // When
	    double actual = bookingService.calculatePrice(bookingRequest);
	    
	    // Then
	    assertEquals(expected, actual);
		  }
	  }
}

```

- Following is kinda stupid to test. Testing always returning 400, by using static mocks

- Currently, we should male our static Mocks more intelligent
	- At the moment if we change `CurrencyConverter` test will always pass since mock is tied to `.toEuro()` call
	- Mockito provides this using **Answer**, they are advanced concepts in mockito
- Previous test would change into following

```
	@Test
	void should_CalculateCorrectPrice() {
		try (MockedStatic<CurrencyConverter> mockedConverter = mockStatic(
				CurrencyConverter.class)) {
			// given
			BookingRequest bookingRequest = new BookingRequest("1", LocalDate.of(2020, 01, 01),
					LocalDate.of(2020, 01, 05), 2, false);
			double expected = 400.0 * 0.8;
			mockedConverter.when(() -> CurrencyConverter.toEuro(anyDouble()))
					.thenAnswer(inv -> (double) inv.getArgument(0) * 0.8);

			// when
			double actual = bookingService.calculatePriceEuro(bookingRequest);

			// then
			assertEquals(expected, actual);
		}

	}
```

- At the time of this recording(2020) Mockito is able to mock **final** methods, using experimental features. Using `mockito-inline` in POM

- We can use this in normal and static methods a like`thenAnswer(inv -> (double) inv.getArgument(0) * 0.8);` 

- What Mockito says about private method mocking

<img src="mockitoPrivate.PNG" alt="alt text" width="500"/>

- Private is ment to **not** call by external code 
	- Why don't test public method which in case calls private method, does not make sense.
	- If u feel that u need to mock private method ‚Üí something is **wrong** with class design

<img src="summary.PNG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>


## PowerMockito

- In old days **PowerMockito** was used for this reasons

<img src="powerMock.PNG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

- Nowadays **Mockito** can 

<img src="latestMockito.PNG" alt="alt text" width="400"/>

- **Junit5** does not support PowerMock, need to use workarounds üò¢
	- PowerMock does **not** update too often, you should not depends on external libraries
